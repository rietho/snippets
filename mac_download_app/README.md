# Mac Download App

Resources to create an App on Mac that directly links to the Download-folder

Note about alternatives:

- Native Download Link: First shows a preview of files. Getting to the folder in Finder needs two clicks, which I'd like to reduce to one.
- Download Folder Alias: Works via one click in the Dock, but has two drawbacks: It can only be attached to the rightmost section of the Dock (where minimized windows are placed). And it does not have an icon, which worsens the UX.

## Install
